/*  Bugs:
      - If click the measures switch rapidly, sometime the two switches become
      both on or both off. Switch the other one once will repair this bug. The 
      measures label will always show the current using measures. Not sure how 
      to fix this, I think it's related to the switch animation effect.       */
